          <h2>What?</h2>
          <p>Having Been a front end developer and being thoroughly inspired by both <a href="http://www.iprug.org">IPRUG</a> and <a href="http://www.londonwebstandards.org/">London Web Standards</a>. I realized that amongst those who work in the web whatever their chosen language and server side system they all share a commion interface, the browser. Not only does this environment reflect the work of developers it also reflects the work of designers, copywriters, photographers and UI and UX designers.</p>
          <p>To this end I&rsquo;m organising a browser user group. A monthly meetup with organised talks on browser based topics, and more importantly a chance to learn and share ideas about how to create amazing experiences on the web.</p>

          <h2>Why?</h2>
          <p>The state of the browser is in constant flux, new fashions skills and techniques are always coming to light, why spend so much time learning them independently? We can teach each other and collectively become better at our chosen skill, be it a designer learning to master javascript to create dynamism in their designs, or a back end developer starting to apply Object Orientated thinking to CSS.</p>
